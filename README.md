# Tic-Tac-Toe

A Java Tic-Tac-Toe app that lets you play against a friend or the computer in either the console or a GUI.

The AI uses a modified version of minimax: instead of assuming you will play optimally, it assumes you will probably play optimally. That way, it won't simply give up when it realizes the game could end in a tie or a loss.
